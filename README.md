# LSMakerModule
This abstract class definition act as a unified public interface for all the LSMaker modules. This unified interface is needed to define a communication contract between the third-party LSMaker modules and the system's scheduler.

For this reason, any third-party module must inherit from LSMakerModule class and override the following
virtual methods:

**MyModule.h**
```
//Include the LSMakerModule class definition
#include "External/LSMakerModule.h"

//Implement the module class inheriting from LSMakerModule class.
class MyModule : public LSMakerModule{

  public:
    void init(void);
    void execute(void);
    void destroy(void);
    String getModuleName(void);

}
```

**MyModule.cpp**
```
#include "MyModule.h"

void MyModule::init(void){
  //Put here the code you want to be executed when the module is attached to
  //the LSMaker scheduler.
}

void MyModule::execute(void){
  //Put here the code of you want to be executed periodically. This method will
  //be called by the LSMaker scheduler automatically. The calling frequency is
  //as soon as possible by default (62.5 us more or less). However, this
  //behaviour can be modified if a period (in microseconds) is provided when //the module is attached to the LSMaker scheduler.
}

void MyModule::destroy(void){
  //Put here the code you want to be executed when the module is detached from
  //the LSMaker scheduler.
}

String MyModule::getModuleName{
  //In this case, we should return a unique string that identifies the module.
  //The module class name is often used as unique identifier but other
  //conventions can be used.
  return "MyModule";
}

```
